# Automatic Quality Assessment: NLP approach for the semantic mapping of texts in the life science

---

## Project description
Beyond the political sphere, the proliferation of disinformation within the fields of medical and life sciences presents a significant challenge to public health. Disinformation is characterized by the incorrectness of information, as well as by the intention to spread the false information. Research attempts to address the issue of incorrectness by automating fact-checking, which comes with several difficulties when applied to research texts. 
The work presented in the article focuses on the intention rather than the fact-checking. Since disinformation follows goals such as making money, gaining attention, or discrediting a competitor, the language style is shaped by these goals. 
State-of-the-art machine learning techniques offer potential solutions to address or mitigate this issue, including methods such as text classification. The development of robust text classification methodologies requires high-quality data sets for training and evaluation. Currently, there are few comprehensive datasets for full-text life sciences with respect to disinformation. In general, the data sets focus on fact-checking short statements which refer to misinformation. To our knowledge, the approach to include the intention has not yet been addressed  by research.   
In this context, we introduce a novel labeled dataset, "Four Shades of Life Sciences". 
This categorization uniquely differentiates various levels of information accuracy beyond a simple binary distinction between disinformation and non-disinformation, enabling a more nuanced analysis based on semantic classification rather than fact-checking.
The data set was compiled in 2024. It contains a total of 2633 items.
